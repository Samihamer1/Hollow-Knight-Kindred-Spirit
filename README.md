# Kindred Spirit

Adds a dream and non dream boss version of the Greenpath Vessel, replacing the statue of the Massive Mosscharger.

Toggle the statue on by hitting with a dream nail, and on the 5th time the dream boss is toggled on: Absolute Kindred Spirit becomes available.
(The Absolute version is a joke, and isn't meant to be beaten.).
